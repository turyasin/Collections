# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Backend changes:
      - Added 7 new endpoints for export (3 formats each for invoices, checks, payments, weekly schedule)
      - Added 3 import endpoints for invoices, checks, and payments (xlsx only)
      - Used openpyxl, python-docx, and reportlab libraries already installed
      - All exports include proper Turkish text, currency formatting (₺), and user information
      - Import endpoints validate Excel structure and assign current user as creator
      
      Frontend changes:
      - Added Export/Import UI to Invoices.jsx, Checks.jsx, Payments.jsx
      - Added Export-only UI to WeeklySchedule.jsx (no import needed)

      - Dialog modals for format selection and file upload
      - File validation (.xlsx only for import)
      - Success/error toast notifications in Turkish
      
      Authentication: All endpoints require valid JWT token (user must be logged in)
      
      Please test all export endpoints with different formats and import endpoints with valid Excel files.
      Test scenarios:
      1. Export each data type in xlsx, docx, and pdf formats
      2. Verify exported files contain correct data with Turkish formatting
      3. Import Excel files for invoices, checks, and payments
      4. Verify imported records are created with correct user attribution
      5. Test error handling for invalid files/formats

      BUG FIX COMPLETED - API ENDPOINT & USER DISPLAY ISSUES RESOLVED
      
      User Reported Issues:
      1. Admin user unable to edit Company Info (view-only mode shown incorrectly)
      2. Logged-in username not displaying in sidebar
      
      Root Cause Analysis:
      - Frontend API calls missing required '/api' prefix for Kubernetes ingress routing
      - App.js not fetching and passing user data to Layout component
      
      Changes Made:
      
      1. CompanyInfo.jsx (/app/frontend/src/components/CompanyInfo.jsx):
         - Fixed: `${API}/users/me` → `${API}/api/users/me` (line 40)
         - Fixed: `${API}/company-info` → `${API}/api/company-info` (lines 53, 103)
         - These changes ensure proper API routing through Kubernetes ingress
      
      2. App.js (/app/frontend/src/App.js):
         - Added: axios import for API calls
         - Added: currentUser state to store user information
         - Added: fetchCurrentUser() function to get user data from /api/users/me
         - Modified: All Route components to pass user={currentUser} prop to Layout
         - Modified: handleLogin() to call fetchCurrentUser() after login
         - This ensures user data is available throughout the application
      
      3. Layout.jsx (no changes needed):
         - Already correctly displays username from user prop
         - Already correctly shows admin badge for admin users
         - Already correctly filters admin-only menu items
      
      Test Results (Manual Testing):
      ✅ Non-Admin User (testadmin@example.com):
         - Username "testadmin" displays in sidebar
         - No admin badge (correct)
         - Company Info shows "Sadece görüntüleme modu" (correct)
         - No "Kaydet" button (correct)
         - No "Arşiv" menu item (correct)
      
      ✅ Admin User (turyasin@gmail.com):
