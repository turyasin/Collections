The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an Ödeme Takip (Payment Tracking) application. Initially, import/export functionality was added to various pages, followed by requests for dashboard export, calendar, and logo management. These additions led to significant frontend JavaScript errors due to mismanaged state, incomplete reverts, and  pointing to production. The engineer meticulously debugged by analyzing logs, console outputs, and Git history, even attempting manual JSX fixes. A key decision by the user to consolidate import/export into a single page helped stabilize the application. Subsequently, user deletion for admins, localization of buttons, and fixes for invoice creation and calendar payment display were successfully implemented. The work concluded with the engineer starting to address mobile responsiveness issues, which was paused by a call to the deployment agent.

<product_requirements>
The Ödeme Takip (Payment Tracking) application facilitates the management of financial records. The implemented features include:
1.  **Core Tracking:** Comprehensive management of customer details, invoices, payment records, and checks.
2.  **User Management:** Multi-user support with a  field for records and an administrative role. Admins can manage user roles, notification preferences, and delete other users.
3.  **Localization:** Full Turkish language support across the entire UI, including all primary action buttons.
4.  **Currency Support:** Turkish Lira (₺) is used as the primary currency for all financial transactions.
5.  **Email Notifications:** Automated email reminders are sent for upcoming invoice collections, configurable by administrators for individual users.
6.  **Check Management:** Dedicated tracking for both issued and received checks, with relevant statistics integrated into the dashboard.
7.  **Weekly Payment Schedule:** Generation of a detailed weekly payment schedule based on recorded invoices and checks.
8.  **Deployment & Portability:** The application is packaged with Docker files and accompanying guides for independent deployment.
9.  **Data Import/Export:** A dedicated İçe/Dışa Aktarım page allows users to export data (Invoices, Checks, Payments, Weekly Plans, Dashboard Summary) in , , and  formats, and import data in  format.
10. **Dashboard Calendar:** An interactive calendar on the dashboard visually displays invoice due dates (red), received checks (green), issued checks (orange), and payments (blue).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback that Uygulama cep versiyonunda düzgün gözükmüyor (the application does not display correctly on mobile). The task was to implement mobile responsive design. The engineer had identified the  file as the starting point for this change, specifically planning to hide the sidebar on mobile and introduce a hamburger menu for navigation. This work was in its initial phase, and no actual code modifications for responsive design in  have been described yet, as the engineer initiated a call to the  to check readiness for deployment, thereby pausing the mobile responsiveness task.
