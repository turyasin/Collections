The trajectory details the extensive development of the Ödeme Takip application. Initial work focused on import/export functionality, calendar, and logo management, which introduced significant frontend issues. These were systematically debugged and resolved, leading to consolidated import/export and various UI/UX improvements. Subsequent development centered on enhancing financial tracking: implementing month/quarter classification for invoices and payments, updating dashboard terminology, and introducing diverse payment methods. A major addition was the Firma Bilgileri panel for managing company details and bank accounts, with currency support and granular admin controls. Throughout, the engineer addressed user feedback, translated UI elements, and implemented visual cues for overdue items. A data archiving system was also built. The trajectory concludes with the engineer debugging persistent  propagation issues on the Company Info page and  errors (due to incorrect  prefixing) for user and company info endpoints.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two user-reported issues: an admin user's inability to edit information on the Firma Bilgileri (Company Info) page and the absence of the logged-in username in the application's sidebar.

For the Firma Bilgileri page, the engineer attempted to resolve an  propagation problem within  by modifying the  hook to ensure the  state was fully updated before the page's loading state was dismissed.

Concurrently,  was updated to fetch user details from the  endpoint and display the . However, during testing, browser console logs showed persistent  errors for both  and  API calls, indicating a recurring issue with the API URL construction, specifically the omission of the required  prefix. The Firma Bilgileri page still displayed Sadece görüntüleme modu (View-only mode), confirming the  issue was not fully resolved. The last action was to inspect the backend  to check the  endpoint definition.
